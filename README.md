# Code-Refactor
## Description
> Motivation of this project was to use problem solving skills to make sure all links are function correctly. 
> Additionally, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure fo the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
> While problem solving and consolidating CSS selectors and properties, I made the observation that I overthink which leads me to not trusting my gut in which results in under-delivering.
